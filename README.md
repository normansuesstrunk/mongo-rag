# 🎬 MongoDB RAG Movie Chat with Streamlit, HuggingFace, and Ollama

A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on top of MongoDB Atlas and LangChain. This app enables natural language queries over movie data using semantic search and a local LLM (Llama3 via Ollama).

## 📌 Project Overview

This project encodes the movies collection from the [sample-mflix](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/) dataset (title, plot, genre, cast, etc.) into vector embeddings using a HuggingFace Transformer Model, stores them in MongoDB Atlas with vector search enabled, and enables semantic search using a local LLM (run locally via [ollama](https://ollama.com/)) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app as a frontend.

🔍 **How It Works**:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Pulls sample movie data from MongoDB Atlas.  
2. **Embedding Generation**: Converts movie metadata into dense vectors using Sentence Transformers.  
3. **Vector Search**: Stores these embeddings in a MongoDB Atlas collection with a vector index.  
4. **RAG Interface**: A Streamlit frontend lets users ask questions in natural language. LangChain retrieves relevant movie documents using vector search, then passes them to the LLM for answer generation.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

## Configuration

The [config.py](config.py) file holds configurations for the used Ollama LLM, the HuggingFace model for embedding, as well as the index names and DB details:

```python
db = "sample_mflix"
collection = "movies"

# Index name created in MongoDB Atlas 
index_name = "movie_embedding_index"
# Field name in MongoDB docs that contains embedding vector 
vector_field_name = "movie_embedding_hf"
# Field that contains text which was embedded 
text_field_name = "embedding_fulltext"

ollama_llm = "llama3.2"

# https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
hf_model = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
vector_size = 768

# Small fast embedding model
# hf_model = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
# vector_size = 384
```

### 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Or use:

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

if you're not using `uv`.

### 2. Load Sample Data in MongoDB Atlas

Create a MongoDB Atlas account, log in, and import the [sample-mflix](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/) dataset. The dataset already contains an `embedded_movies` collection with embeddings for the `plot` field. You will index the `movies` collection from scratch with a HuggingFace Transformers model.

### 3. Create Vector Search Index in MongoDB Atlas

Go to your MongoDB Atlas cluster and create a Vector Search Index named `movie_embedding_index` on the `movie_embedding_hf` field:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "path": "movie_embedding_hf",
      "type": "vector",
      "numDimensions": 768,
      "similarity": "cosine"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Export your MongoDB connection string:

```bash
export MONGO_CONNECTION="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>"
```

### 🧠 Run Embedding Script

This script encodes metadata fields into vector embeddings and stores them in your MongoDB Atlas collection.

```bash
python encode_movie_collection.py
```

### ✅ Verifying Vectorized Documents

To check which documents have already been embedded, use this MongoDB query:

```json
{ "movie_embedding_hf": { "$exists": true } }
```

### 🤖 Start the LLM Backend (Ollama)

Make sure Ollama is installed and run your local LLM (e.g., LLaMA 3):

```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

### 🚀 Launch the Streamlit Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This opens a web app where you can enter natural language queries and see relevant movie data retrieved and answered by the LLM.
